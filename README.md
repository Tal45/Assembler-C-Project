Project Overview
This project implements a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical assembly language. The assembler translates assembly language source code into machine code, performing lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation in two passes.

Features
Two-Pass Processing: Ensures accurate resolution of symbols and addresses.
Error Handling: Detects and reports syntax and semantic errors.
Symbol Table Management: Efficient handling of labels and variables.
Output Files: Generates machine code, symbol table, and listing files.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Make (optional, for build automation)
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/two-pass-assembler.git
cd two-pass-assembler
Compile the assembler:

sh
Copy code
gcc -o assembler assembler.c
Or, if using Make:

sh
Copy code
make
Usage
Running the Assembler
To assemble a source file, run the following command:

sh
Copy code
./assembler source.asm
Input File Format
The assembler expects the source file to be in a specific format. [Provide details on the expected assembly language syntax, instructions, directives, etc.]

Output Files
Machine Code File: output.o
Symbol Table File: symbol_table.txt
Listing File: listing.lst
Code Structure
assembler.c: Main source file containing the implementation of the assembler.
lexer.c and lexer.h: Lexical analysis module.
parser.c and parser.h: Syntax analysis and parsing module.
codegen.c and codegen.h: Code generation module.
Makefile: Build automation script.
